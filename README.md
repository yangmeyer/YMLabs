YMLabs
--------
Every day, I learn new things about iOS development. To try something out, I often create a bare-bones project, add the necessary stubs, and then either write some unit tests or build a simple UI playground for my experiment. I will publish these mini-projects here.

ARC
------
Most, if not all, example projects use ARC. You should, too.

Submodules
------
For some of the examples, you need to initialize the submodules:

	$ git submodule init && git submodule update

Usage
------
Feel free to use what you find, and let me know what you think. Iâ€™m [@yangmeyer](http://twitter.com/yangmeyer) on Twitter, or say [hello@yangmeyer.de](mailto:hello@yangmeyer.de).
